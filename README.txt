INSTRUCTIONS FOR BST ASSIGNMENT:

	This program should ideally spit out a list of all members of the given array, organized as a binary tree. It will appear sorted, lowest to highest.
		TESLA: use winSCP to upload the program and the makefile to tesla. Then, simply run the following commands:
				>>make
				>>make run
			 Note that this will require you to rename your makefile.mak to simply "makefile" in order to function. Also note that this program wields a pretty hefty compilation
			 time, so if it takes some time to compile, that is not a local issue.
		LOCAL: place program into preferred directory on g++/makefile compatible computer. Either modify your makefile so that "./a.out" reads "./a.exe", or run the following commands:
				>>g++ binaryTree.cpp
				>>./a.exe
				
	Note that the given source file has commented-out methods for removal. These will likely be updated in future builds, but for the sake of grading this assignment were left 
		non-functional due to their lack of impact on the requirements. Any questions regarding this implementation can be directed to dkruze@iu.edu.
